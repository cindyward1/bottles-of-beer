## Requirements for execution:

The _git_ software must be installed; installation instructions can be found [here](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

_git clone_ the image available at http://github.com/cindyward1/bottles-of-beer.git, which will create a bottles-of-beer directory with cs, images, js, and spec directories.

To execute the software, open the file (clone location)/bottles-of-beer/bottles-of-beer.html in a browser window. 

You can also test a non-interactive version of the methods against their test cases found in (clone location)/bottles-of-beer/spec/specs.js using opening the file (clone location)/bottles-of-beer/spec/spec-runner-html in a browser window.
